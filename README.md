# fairlyfloss-dark 🍭🦄🌇

Theme based on the [`fairlyfloss`](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/) theme that is a bit less candy and pastel - more a late evening dream.  
Available as `tmTheme` and `rstheme`.

### Notes on `.rstheme` installation*

To install custom themes in RStudio, you must have the [daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com/) installed.

With the daily build, you can import either the [tmTheme file](https://github.com/Z3tt/fairlyfloss-dark/blob/master/fairyfloss_dark.tmTheme) or the [rstheme file](https://github.com/Z3tt/fairlyfloss-dark/blob/master/fairyfloss_dark.rstheme) by going to `Preferences >> Appearance >> Add` (see gif below — fairlyfloss_dark not actually shown).

In order to modify the imported rstheme file, you'll need to go to:

- Mac: **`/Users/<you>/.R/rstudio/themes`**
- Linux: **`/home/<you>/.R/rstudio/themes`**
- Windows: **`C:/Users/<you>/Documents/.R/rstudio/themes`**

There, you'll find the imported theme as `fairyfloss_dark.rstheme`.
